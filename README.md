scAtlasLC (single-cell Atlas in Liver Cancer) is a publicly available data portal of single-cell transcriptomic profiles of tumor cell communities in hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

scAtlasLC can be used to evaluate gene expression in malignant cells and various non-malignant cells in liver cancer. It can be further used to determine gene expression in different subtypes of stromal cells and immune cells.

The single-cell data used for scAtlasLC can be downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus: [GSE151530](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE151530)
