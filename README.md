scAtlasLC (single-cell Atlas in Liver Cancer) is a publicly available data portal of single-cell transcriptomic profiles of tumor cell communities in hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

scAtlasLC can be used to evaluate gene expression in malignant cells and various non-malignant cells in liver cancer. It can be further used to determine gene expression in different subtypes of stromal cells and immune cells.

Current single-cell data used for scAtlasLC includes the following:
